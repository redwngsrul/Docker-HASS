# redwngsrul's Home Assistant
###### Readme is always a work in progress

#### Since I had a NAS running as a Plex server, I recently moved my Home Assistant over to my QNAP NAS running in a docker container. I found the process very easy to get up an running and it's pretty easy to manage and update.
